<h2>Northwind Traders</h2>
<p style="font-size: .75em;">The project was for completing the Northwind Traders contest presented by <a href="https://www.mavenanalytics.io/challenges/maven-northwind-challenge/24?utm_source=linkedin&amp;utm_campaign=mavennorthwindchallenge_li_maven" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Maven Analytics</strong></a></p>
<p style="font-size: .75em;">In the root folder there are two files the HR_Recursion.py file and the NorthwindTraders.py file. The NorthwindTrades file has any data transformations and the merging of the csv files to create the data set for the <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/cole.smith/viz/MavenNorthwindChallenge_16864990533110/NorthwindDashboard target=" rel="noopener"><strong>dashboard</strong></a></p>
<p style="font-size: .75em;">The HR_Recursion file is dedicated to the code for building a General Tree data structure to house the hierarchial employee data based on the employee csv in the <a href="https://github.com/cosmith1622/Portfolio/tree/master/NorthwindTraders/Data target=" rel="noopener"><strong>Data</strong></a> directory. The employees csv file in the Data directory is the raw data in the transformation. If you want to see the results of the data structure go to the csv_test.csv file at the root of the NorthwindTraders directory. The dashboard referenced above uses a recurisve with statment in sql to enhance the data set for the dashboard.&nbsp; The HR_Recursion was used as different way to perform the same task.</p>
