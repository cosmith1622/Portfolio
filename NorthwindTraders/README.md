------ NorthwindTraders -------

The project was a contest by Maven Analytics (https://www.mavenanalytics.io/challenges/maven-northwind-challenge/24?utm_source=linkedin&utm_campaign=mavennorthwindchallenge_li_maven).  
All of the files presented by Maven are in the Data directory.
I added the HR_Recursion.py and the NorthwindTraders.py file.
The HR_Recursion.py file demonstrates using a General Tree
as a way to build a recursive hierarchy for the employee data
set in the Data folder. The csv_test.csv file 
is result of running the HR_Recursion file. The NorthwindTraders.py file has
the code that was used to generate the data.csv file in the Data folder
which was used to create the Tableau dashboard.  

The goal of the contest was to build a dashboard that provided insight 
on KPI for the shipping business.  Maven provided the following data sets:

1. categories.csv
2. customers.csv
3. employees.csv
4. order_details.csv
5. orders.csv
6. products.csv
7. shippers.csv

to the dashboard where the data.csv file is used.
